Shipping Calculator and Database for the Aquarium Industry

TL;DR - creates and initializes a database for calculating shipment costs within the aquarium industry. The goal is to provide mass information for stores to then be able to calculate what I define as "the Real Cost" of a fish in order to figure out profit margins, as well as optimal times for ordering fish of certain species or from certain localities.
