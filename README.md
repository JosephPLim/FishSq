# FishSq
Shipping Calculator and Database for the Aquarium Industry

TL;DR - creates and initializes a database for calculating shipment costs within the aquarium industry. The goal is to provide mass information for stores to then be able to calculate what I define as "the Real Cost" of a fish in order to figure out profit margins, as well as optimal times for ordering fish of certain species or from certain localities.


FishSqInitialize.sql - Initializes the FishSq database. Assuming that different stores are going to be using their own collected data (and no other store's data), it's important that each database be able to run independently using its own tables. Tables and Column names are defined within this file.
